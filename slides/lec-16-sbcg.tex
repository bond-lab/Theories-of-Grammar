\myslide{Overview}
\MyLogo{Sag, Wasow and Bender (2003) --- Chapter 16}

\begin{itemize}
\item Chapter 16 framework (same analyses, 
different underlying system)
\item General wrap up
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Construction Grammar (CxG)}

\begin{itemize}
\item A family of grammars based on the idea that
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Knowledge of a language comes from \emp{form and function pairings}
  \item \txx{function} includes meaning, content, or intent 
    (both semantics and pragmatics)
  \item \txx{form} includes phonology, syntax, orthography
  \end{itemize}
\item CxG grew out of generative semantics and cognitive linguistics,
  by researchers such as Charles Fillmore, Paul Kay and George Lakoff
\item Instead of language as a grammar+lexicon, think of it as a
  structured network of families of constructions
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Construction Grammars}
\begin{itemize}
\item \txx{Sign-based-Construction Grammar} (Berkeley Construction Grammar)
  \\  unification-based framework (with computational implementation)
\item \txx{Goldbergian/Lakovian Construction Grammar}
  \\ psychologically plausible
\item \txx{Radical Construction Grammar}
  \\ syntactic categories, roles, and relations are not universal: 
  \\ they are not only language-specific, but also construction specific 
\item \txx{Embodied Construction Grammar}
  \\ relates constructions to embodiment and sensorimotor experience
\item \txx{Fluid Construction Grammar}
  \\ learns grammars from the environment (with computational implementation)
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Overview of Differences (SBCG vs HPSG)}

\begin{itemize}
\item Multiple Inheritance
\item Signs
\item Grammar rules form a hierarchy --- many more rules
\item Every tree node has its own phonology
\item Many principles become constraints on 
grammar rules
\item The definition of well-formedness is 
simplified
\end{itemize}




\section{Wrap Up}

\myslide{Big picture: Our model}
\begin{center}
  \LARGE HPSG \\
  \Large Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar  
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item Describes a set of strings
\item Associates semantic representations (and
trees) with well-formed strings
\begin{itemize}
\item Is stated in terms of declarative constraints
\item[\ldots]  which are order-independent
\item Locates most constraints `in the lexicon'
\item Is stated in a precise fashion
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Parts of our model}
\begin{itemize}
\item Type hierarchy (lexical types, other types)
\item Phrase structure rules
\item Lexical rules
\item Lexical entries
\item Grammatical principles
\item Initial symbol
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Universals in our model}
\begin{itemize}
%\item Case constraint 
\item SHAC
\item Binding theory
\item Head-complement/-specifier/-modifier
\item Head Feature Principle
\item Valence Principle
\item Semantic Compositionality Principle
\item \ldots 
\end{itemize}


% \myslide{Key characteristics}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Surface-oriented
% \item Constraint-based
% \item Lexicalist
% \end{itemize}
% \myslide{Psycholinguistic Evidence}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Evidence for left-to-right effects
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item Disfluencies are sensitive to structure
%   \item Repeat rate of \eng{the} varies with position and complexity of the NP it introduces
%   \item More complex NPs produce more disfluency
%   \end{itemize}
% \item Evidence for top-down planning
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item Agreement errors are more common with PP complements
% than sentential complements: errors like (2) are significantly
% more common than errors like (1).
% \begin{exe}
%   \ex \eng{*The claim that the wolves had raised the babies were rejected.
%   \ex \eng{*The claim about the newborn babies were rejected.
% \end{exe}
% \end{itemize}
% \end{itemize}


% \myslide{So what?}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Speculation: Clauses are their own agreement domains, so people don't
% mistake an NP in a lower clause as a trigger for agreement

% \item Grammar plays a role in production.
% \item Partial grammatical information should be accessible by
% the production mechanism as needed.
% % \begin{itemize}
% % \item This argues against grammatical theories that involve
% % sequential derivations with fixed ordering.
% % \begin{itemize}
% \item Our theory of grammar has the requisite flexibility.
% \end{itemize}


% \myslide{Speakers know a great deal about individual words}
% \begin{itemize}\addtolength{\itemsep}{-1ex}
% \item Individual lexical items have many idiosyncrasies in
% where they can occur, and in where they tend to
% occur.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item For example, the verb \textit{behoove} occurs only with the
% subject it (and only in certain verb forms), and the
% verb \textit{beware} has only the base form.
% \item Transitive use of \textit{walk} is much rarer than the intransitive.
% \end{itemize}
% \item Lexical biases influence processing
% \item Wasow et al ran a production experiment to test
% whether ambiguity avoidance would influence
% speakers' choice between the following:
% \begin{exe}
%   \ex \eng{They gave Grant's letters to Lincoln to a museum.
%   \ex \eng{ They gave a museum Grant's letters to Lincoln.
% \end{exe}
% \item 
% Lexical bias of the verbs turned out to be a significant
% predictor of which form speakers used (and ambiguity
% avoidance turned out not to be).
% \end{itemize}

% % \myslide{Experimental Method}

% % LISTENER

% % SPEAKER

% % 1. Speaker silently reads a sentence:
% % A museum in Philadelphia received Grant's
% % letters to Lincoln from the foundation.

% % \myslide{Experimental Method, continued}
% % What did the
% % foundation do?

% % LISTENER

% % SPEAKER

% % 2. The sentence disappears from the screen.
% % The listener reads the next question from a list.

% % \myslide{Experimental Method, continued}
% % The foundation gave \ldots . the
% % museum, um, Grant's letter's
% % to Lincoln.

% % LISTENER

% % SPEAKER

% % 3. The speaker answers the listener's question.
% % The listener chooses the correct response on
% % a list (from two choices).

% % \myslide{Experimental Results on Local Ambiguity}
% % V-NP-PP bias
% % V-NP-NP bias

% % 100%
% % 75%
% % 50%
% % 25%
% % 0%

% % % NP NP

% % No potential local ambiguity

% % Potential local ambiguity

% % \myslide{Reverse ambiguity effect}
% % \begin{itemize}
% % \item Arnold, Wasow, Asudeh \& Alrenga 2004
% % Journal of Memory \& Language
% % \begin{itemize}
% % \item Re-ran the experiment with slightly better

% % methodology and found a stronger reverse
% % ambiguity effect.


% \myslide{A psychologically real grammar should be lexicalist}
% \begin{itemize}
% %\item Early generative grammars downplayed the lexicon.
% \item Now the importance of the lexicon is widely
% recognized.
% \item This aspect of grammar has been developed in greater
% detail in HPSG than in any other.
% \end{itemize}

% \myslide{Conclusion}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Grammatical theory should inform and be informed
% by psycholinguistic experimentation.
% \item This has happened less than it should have.
% \item Existing psycholinguistic evidence favors a
% constraint-based, lexicalist approach (like ours).
% \end{itemize}
