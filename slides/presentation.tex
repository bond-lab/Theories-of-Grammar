\begin{itemize}
\item The analysis can be in terms of HPSG or GB or both.
\item It can be a more detailed look at something that is in the textbooks.
\item The analysis should not be original, the goal is to show that
  you can understand existing research and explain it to others
  clearly.
\item You should read multiple papers.
\item You should clearly indicate the source of the analysis you will present.
\item[*] Email the bibliographical information of the  main paper you
  will be referring to to your coordinator (\texttt{bond\@ieee.org})
  by Week 9.
\item You should use slides \textbf{and you should have slide numbers}
  
\end{itemize}
